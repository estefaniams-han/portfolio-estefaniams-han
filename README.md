Welcome to my interactive **3D portfolio**, a cozy little corner of the web where creativity, code, and curiosity bloom together 🌷

This space reflects how much I adore combining **technology and art** — it’s built with **Three.js**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, and all the models were handcrafted by me in **Blender** because I genuinely *love* 3D modeling and creating immersive worlds 💕

I got inspired by [Andrew Woan’s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3pPAdQBKHo) work — his way of blending simplicity and interaction motivated me to bring my own **Digital Garden** to life.

⚙️ Note: This project is still growing! I’m in the process of adding all my projects and polishing the interactions, so consider it a work in progress 🌱

## 🪞 Overview
This portfolio isn’t just a showcase — it’s a tiny world that grows with me. Each 3D element represents part of my journey: projects I’ve built, lessons I’ve learned, and ideas I’ve yet to plant 🌱. You can click around and explore my universe through **billboards** that tell little stories about my work and passions. Also you can see there some of my favorite animals!

## 🛠️ Built With
- **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **JavaScript (ES6)**  
- **Blender** (for modeling)  
- **Three.js** for rendering 3D scenes
- **OrbitControls** for smooth camera movement
- **GLTFLoader** for importing Blender models
- **Octree** and **Capsule** for simple physics and collision detection

## 🧠 Inspiration

This project is my love letter to **3D modeling** and **interactive storytelling**. I’ve always believed technology can express beauty, softness, and emotion — and this portfolio is my way of proving that ✨

Inspired by Andrew Woan’s creations and the idea of *Digital Gardens*, this world evolves as I grow — always learning, always adding new blooms.
